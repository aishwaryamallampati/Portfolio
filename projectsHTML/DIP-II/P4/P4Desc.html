        <p>Input: An image containing five sets of differntly-sized solid black disks randomly scattered in the image.</p>
        <p>Task: Design appropriate hit-or-miss transform to detect the smallest and largest disks.</p>
        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thresholded the input image to convert it into binary image</li>
            <li>Removed noise by applying closing operation</li>
            <li>Created structuring elements to detect small and large disks</li>
            <li>Applied hit or miss transform using the structuring elements to get the final result</li>
        </ul>
