        <p><strong>Homotopic Skeletonization</strong></p>
        <p>Task:Perfom thinning on an image to find its skeleton</p>
        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Created eight structuring elements to remove boundaries of an image</li>
            <li>To get the skeleton of an image, thinning operation has to be performed on the input image over multiple iterations</li>
            <li>Hit or miss transform is performed using all the eight structuring elements in every    iteration</li>
            <li>The resultant thinned image after every iteration is compared with the resultant
                image in previous iteration, if both are same then the image cannot be thinned
                any more so the algorithm is halted.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Shape Analysis</strong></p>
        <p>Input: Image containing distinct objects and another image containing the same image but each object is rotated by certain angle.</p>
        <p>Task: Perform shape analysis to find most similar objects.</p>
        <p>Steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Bounding box of each object is computed</li>
            <li>Calculated size distribution, pecstrum and shape complexity of each object</li>
            <li>Distances between objects in each image are compared to select the most similar object.</li>
        </ul>
