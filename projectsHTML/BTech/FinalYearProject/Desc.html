        <p>Details of Transfer Function Generation for Direct Volume Rendering:</p>
        <p>Goal: The main goal of this project is to formulate a method to generate transfer function for direct volume rendering that works at interactive speed.</p>
        <p>Algorithm: The algorithm for transfer function generator is designed as a two-step process:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The first step focuses on the computation of boundary characteristics of the input volume.</li>
            <li>In this step, the algorithm finds the data values corresponding to the object.</li>
            <li>In order to visualize different parts of the object, data values corresponding to the object are divided into multiple subsections using accumulative probability distribution of volume data.</li>
            <li>In the second step, a threshold data value is computed in each subsection. </li>
            <li>These threshold data values act as piecewise nodes of the opacity transfer function which is given to Direct Volume Rendering algorithm.</li>
            <li>The user can set opacity to each threshold data value using sliders and visualize the changes in the rendered volume instantly.</li>
        </ul>
